# ICPC Resolver Clone

Resolver is the most exciting part of ICPC (International Collegiate Programming Contest) finale to me. It always fascinated me how they do it. I tried using their tool with a dummy scoreboard but it was too intertwined with a lot of other services. So this is my little attempt to replicate the software that has fascinated me for years. Used Svelte for easy animation.

#### The animation only works in firefox browser. Chrome can't run Svelte animation for some reason.

## Installation

```
npm install
npm run dev
```
